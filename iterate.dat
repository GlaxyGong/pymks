RUNNING THE L-BFGS-B CODE

it    = iteration number
nf    = number of function evaluations
nseg  = number of segments explored during the Cauchy search
nact  = number of active bounds at the generalized Cauchy point
sub   = manner in which the subspace minimization terminated:
        con = converged, bnd = a bound was reached
itls  = number of iterations performed in the line search
stepl = step length used
tstep = norm of the displacement (total step)
projg = norm of the projected gradient
f     = function value
