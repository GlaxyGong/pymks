Kalindindi Presentation
----------------------

 * Materials Inovation Ecosystem

   * Expertise in different areas -- workshops for integrated materials such as MKS and big data.

 * MinED Materials group

   * experimental datasets simulation datastes and produce MinED knowledge.

   * invertible SPP (structure property) linkages

 * MinED workflow

   * data -> segmentation (microstructure descriptors) -> statistical models (N-point stats) -> data-mining (localization (MKS), homogenization, taxonomy) -> assessment -> data

   * microstucture informatics

 * scale-briding

   * localization - homogenization

   * \dot\epsilon = a < \dot\epsilon >

   * obtain the localization tensor

 * elastic localization tensor

   * perturbation

   * Lippman-Schwinger equation iterative using FFT, (Lebensohn, IJP, 32-33, 59-69, 2012)

   * \epsilon\prime = a \avg\epsilon

   * Kroner's book

   * recursive equation for localization equation

   * Issues

     * multiscale requires doing this millions of times, very stiff, requires intensive computation
 
     * no way to accumule results, not using previous information, start over each time

 * Kroner's Statistical Continuum Theories

   * principal value problem

   * Green's function captures the physics

   * all convolutions

   * non-linear properties have to be dealt with carefully

   * convergence is difficult for hight contrast composites

 * analogies

   * approach is broad, ising, potts, generalized configuration hamiltonian expansions, same sort of terms

   * Volterra series are similar in signal processing

 * Linear Time Invariant Systems

   * x(t) -> f(x(t)) -> y(t)=f(x(t))            ==>         x(t-k) -> f(x(t-k)) -> y(t-k)

   * x(t) = \sum x_k(k) \delta(t - k)

   * MKS is space invariant similar

   * break solution down to a set of impulse functions -- linearity and time invariance in the black box -- can always be represented as a convolution functions

   * impulse input - output gives a set of convolution functions. Can then get answers quickly once the convolutioon functions are found

 * Harmonic oscilator

   * find the impulse function (Green's function or Fourier Transform)

 * Elastic Localization Tensor

   * Systems Theory

   * Use Volterra series representations

   * input signal is the microstructure

   * output signal is the local strain tensor

   * convolution base on Green's function 
  
   * m - mocrostructure
  
   * \alpha - convolution filters (Green's functions)

   
 * MKS approach

   * 3 signal
   
     * microstructure signal

     * response signal

     * microstructure evolution

Tony Fast - Elementes of the Materials Knowledge Systems
========================================================

 * Make it faster not better

 * MKS
  
   * ROBUS - structure property processing linkages

   * SCALABLE - NlogN complexity - FE N**3 versus FD N**2 complexity (what is FV?)

 * problem of multiscale

 * concurrent multiscale

   * homogenization
 
   * smaller scale simulation and then homogenize

 * Data versus Knowledge

   * Needs to be done for every position in the material (expensive)
  
   * extract numerical knowledge

   * take on digital signal and look for response using Kroner's Green function

   * use influence coefficients to quickly generate results

     * influence coefficients  extract, store and recall material properties
 
 * digital signal processing

   * response field -> microstructure

   * p_s (response), m microstructure signal, alpha is the mapping

 * using MKS to blur image

   * square filter convolved with image

   * emboss, spinodal etc

   * extract kernel for spinoidal decomp and look at how image evolves

 * spectral efficiency of MKS

   * coefficients calibrated to validate direct numerical simulations

   * p_s -> FT -> P

Microstructures as Digital Signals
==================================

 * how good the influence coeffs depends on the microstructure characterization

 * informatics workflow

   * what is the input and output?

   * segmentation creats digital signal

 * segmentation extracts important features

   * extract data from image

 * the primative bases converts \muS to a digital signal

   * first order

   * m can be 0 or 1 for example

   * discrete: m^h_s = 0 or 1 

   * continuum: m is volume fraction

   * \sum m v^h = \beta where \beta = 0 or 1

   * this is interpolation in amplitude

   * higher order convolution functions

     * subset of HO Voltera kernels

     * becomes intractable to bin higher order representations

   * primitive basis, delta functions, pulse functions

 * Use Euler function for description of microsturcture

Why FT? -- Anne Hanna
=====================

 * calibrate microstrucures with MKS coefficients

   * use least squares fit

   * calibrate alphas

   * all plausibe products

   * big system need FT

 * Fourier doconv

   * FFT reduces first order MKS to a small matrix for least sqpuares
     fitting

   * P_s -> P_k

   * normalization is unity

 * Proof of convolution

Calibrating the influence coefficients
======================================

 * ordinary least squares fitting

 * S is huge for bos standard least squares

 * reduces size of simulation because the important stuff only happens
   in reduced space.

 * calibration reduction with FE simulations

 * multiple microstructures

 * higher order terms increases accuracy with carefull choice of terms

Converstation with Tony Fast
----------------------------

 * Data needs to be manipulated and tied back to original source.

 * 2 data streams to solve domain specific problems.

 * curation of the knowledge into collabritive domains.

 * only knwoledge from domain specific, granularity is important

 * provenance is an issue 

 * scaling and machine learning, data discovery and knowledge discovery

 * data curation group at NIST is thinking about versioning

 * DANSE project
